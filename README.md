## PS1 First-Order Covariance Propagation
In this task, we discussed about the linearization error we met during the SLAM procedure. Often the linearization process is required for that some of the filter could only operated linearized and Gaussian system. 
I first generate a point cloud representing 10,000 samples form the distribution over the position of the object as measured sensor frame (i.e. r,<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta">) and the Cartesian (x,y) coordinate frame. It was generated by utilizing <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu"> + <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma*randn">. 
As shown in the following picture
